# Write Spec

Write a feature specification or product requirements document (PRD).

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Feature

Ask the user what they want to spec. Accept any of:
- A feature name ("SSO support")
- A problem statement ("Enterprise customers keep asking for centralized auth")
- A user request ("Users want to export their data as CSV")
- A vague idea ("We should do something about onboarding drop-off")

### 2. Gather Context

Ask the user for the following. Be conversational — do not dump all questions at once. Ask the most important ones first and fill in gaps as you go:

- **User problem**: What problem does this solve? Who experiences it?
- **Target users**: Which user segment(s) does this serve?
- **Success metrics**: How will we know this worked?
- **Constraints**: Technical constraints, timeline, regulatory requirements, dependencies
- **Prior art**: Has this been attempted before? Are there existing solutions?

### 3. Pull Context from Connected Tools

If a **project tracker** is connected:
- Search for related tickets, epics, or features
- Pull in any existing requirements or acceptance criteria
- Identify dependencies on other work items

If a **knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for related research documents, prior specs, or design docs
- Pull in relevant user research findings
- Find related meeting notes or decision records

If a **design tool** is connected:
- Pull related mockups, wireframes, or design explorations
- Search for design system components relevant to the feature

If these tools are not connected, work entirely from what the user provides. Do not ask the user to connect tools — just proceed with available information.

### 4. Generate the PRD

Write the PRD with the sections in **PRD Structure** below, in that order. Read `references/prd-guidance.md` when writing user stories, acceptance criteria, success metrics, or when the scope keeps growing.

### 5. Review and Iterate

After generating the PRD:
- Ask the user if any sections need adjustment
- Offer to expand on specific sections
- Offer to create follow-up artifacts (design brief, engineering ticket breakdown, stakeholder pitch)

## PRD Structure

### Problem Statement
- Describe the user problem in 2-3 sentences
- Who experiences this problem and how often
- What is the cost of not solving it (user pain, business impact, competitive risk)
- Ground this in evidence: user research, support data, metrics, or customer feedback

### Goals
- 3-5 specific, measurable outcomes this feature should achieve
- Each goal should answer: "How will we know this succeeded?"
- Distinguish between user goals (what users get) and business goals (what the company gets)
- Goals should be outcomes, not outputs ("reduce time to first value by 50%" not "build onboarding wizard")

### Non-Goals
- 3-5 things this feature explicitly will NOT do
- Adjacent capabilities that are out of scope for this version
- For each non-goal, briefly explain why it is out of scope (not enough impact, too complex, separate initiative, premature)
- Non-goals prevent scope creep during implementation and set expectations with stakeholders

### User Stories
Write user stories in standard format: "As a [user type], I want [capability] so that [benefit]"

Guidelines:
- The user type should be specific enough to be meaningful ("enterprise admin" not just "user")
- The capability should describe what they want to accomplish, not how
- The benefit should explain the "why" — what value does this deliver
- Include edge cases: error states, empty states, boundary conditions
- Include different user types if the feature serves multiple personas
- Order by priority — most important stories first

Example:
- "As a team admin, I want to configure SSO for my organization so that my team members can log in with their corporate credentials"
- "As a team member, I want to be automatically redirected to my company's SSO login so that I do not need to remember a separate password"
- "As a team admin, I want to see which members have logged in via SSO so that I can verify the rollout is working"

### Requirements

**Must-Have (P0)**: The feature cannot ship without these. These represent the minimum viable version of the feature. Ask: "If we cut this, does the feature still solve the core problem?" If no, it is P0.

**Nice-to-Have (P1)**: Significantly improves the experience but the core use case works without them. These often become fast follow-ups after launch.

**Future Considerations (P2)**: Explicitly out of scope for v1 but we want to design in a way that supports them later. Documenting these prevents accidental architectural decisions that make them hard later.

For each requirement:
- Write a clear, unambiguous description of the expected behavior
- Include acceptance criteria (see below)
- Note any technical considerations or constraints
- Flag dependencies on other teams or systems

### Success Metrics
- Leading indicators (move within days or weeks) and lagging indicators (weeks or months)
- Each with a specific target, how it is measured, and when it will be checked

### Open Questions
- Questions that need answers before or during implementation
- Tag each with who should answer (engineering, design, legal, data, stakeholder)
- Distinguish between blocking questions (must answer before starting) and non-blocking (can resolve during implementation)

### Timeline Considerations
- Hard deadlines (contractual commitments, events, compliance dates)
- Dependencies on other teams' work or releases
- Suggested phasing if the feature is too large for one release

## Output Format

Use markdown with clear headers. Keep the document scannable — busy stakeholders should be able to read just the headers and bold text to get the gist.

## Tips

- Be opinionated about scope. It is better to have a tight, well-defined spec than an expansive vague one.
- If the user's idea is too big for one spec, suggest breaking it into phases and spec the first phase.
- Success metrics should be specific and measurable, not vague ("improve user experience").
- Non-goals are as important as goals. They prevent scope creep during implementation.
- Open questions should be genuinely open — do not include questions you can answer from context.

## Project adjustments

If the current project has adjustments for this skill (the product, its users, the metrics that matter, a house spec template), apply them. Where they disagree with these instructions, the project's adjustments win.
